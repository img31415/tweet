ðŸš€ Instruction to Tweet App
1. Go to the directory of tweet/app
```
C:\Users\user\tweet\app
```

2. Install the dependency packages with below command
```
yarn install
```

3. Start the server by typing the below command
```
gatsby develop
```

4. It is now running at localhost:8000 
```
http://localhost:8000/
```

**Provided server url (http://tweetsaver.herokuapp.com/?q=obama&callback=yourJSONPCallbackFn&count=10) is currently not available to fetch data from because of CORS, 
So I have set the fake data and search function will work like it is supposed to once the program can fetch the data from the given url. 

Thank you.
